Various Tools which I've developing to help with day-to-day technical work and help me learn to code.

Current tools:
vSAN performance calculator, this translates current IO into vSAN IO based on 8KB blocks
Front-end performance calculator, there are a million front-to-back calculotors for RAID but this does it the other way
Disk Group calculator, this figures out how many RAID groups you need to meet a certain percentage of a pool. I've done this in both vue js and regular js
vSAN Capaacity calculator, this is designed to help tweak vSAN ready node designs or figure out a design based on vSAN approved parts.
It is not designed to select the node so some knowledge of vSAN is needed.

Note that none of these tools have any assosication with VMware and I take no responsibility for any issues resulting in their use.
